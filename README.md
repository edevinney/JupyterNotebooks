# Mapping Rent Pressure Zones in Ireland
There doesn't seem to be a polygon file for RPZs, so here is one as of the November 2023 update from the Housing Agency.

The notebook slices up Tailte Eireann's Local Election Area goeJSON to match both the text and map description on the Housing Agency's web site.

The code is free for use under Apache 2.0. The geojson is derived from Tailte Eireann, under CC-BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). 
Use either or both at your own risk.
