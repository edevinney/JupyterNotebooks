# Mapping Rent Pressure Zones in Ireland
There doesn't seem to be a polygon file for RPZs, so here is one as of the November 2023 update from the Housing Agency. Also available are aggregation by county and a single multipolygon for the entire country.

The notebook slices up Tailte Eireann's Local Election Area geoJSON to match both the text and map description on the Housing Agency's web site.
